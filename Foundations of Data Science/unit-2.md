# Plotting the classics
### 5 minutes
In this example, we will explore statistics for two classic novels: The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn by Mark Twain, and Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The text of any book can be read by a computer at great speed. Books published before 1923 are currently in the public domain, meaning that everyone has the right to copy or use the text in any way. [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is a website that publishes public domain books online. Using Python, we can load the text of these books directly from the web.

This example is meant to illustrate some of the broad themes of this text. Don't worry if the details of the program don't yet make sense. Instead, focus on interpreting the images generated below. Later sections of the text will describe most of the features of the Python programming language used below.

First, we read the text of both books into lists of chapters, called huck_finn_chapters and little_women_chapters. In Python, a name cannot contain any spaces, and so we will often use an underscore _ to stand in for a space. The = in the lines below give a name on the left to the result of some computation described on the right. A uniform resource locator or URL is an address on the Internet for some content; in this case, the text of a book. The # symbol starts a comment, which is ignored by the computer but helpful for people reading the code.

```python
# Read two books, fast!

huck_finn_url = 'https://www.inferentialthinking.com/data/huck_finn.txt'
huck_finn_text = read_url(huck_finn_url)
huck_finn_chapters = huck_finn_text.split('CHAPTER ')[44:]

little_women_url = 'https://www.inferentialthinking.com/data/little_women.txt'
little_women_text = read_url(little_women_url)
little_women_chapters = little_women_text.split('CHAPTER ')[1:]
```

While a computer cannot understand the text of a book, it can provide us with some insight into the structure of the text. The name huck_finn_chapters is currently bound to a list of all the chapters in the book. We can place them into a table to see how each chapter begins.

```python
# Display the chapters of Huckleberry Finn in a table.

Table().with_column('Chapters', huck_finn_chapters)
```

```

Each chapter begins with a chapter number in Roman numerals, followed by the first sentence of the chapter. Project Gutenberg has printed the first word of each chapter in upper case.

## Literary characters
The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn describes a journey that Huck and Jim take along the Mississippi River. Tom Sawyer joins them towards the end as the action heats up. Having loaded the text, we can quickly visualize how many times these characters have each been mentioned at any point in the book.

```Python
# Count how many times the names Jim, Tom, and Huck appear in each chapter.

counts = Table().with_columns([
        'Jim', np.char.count(huck_finn_chapters, 'Jim'),
        'Tom', np.char.count(huck_finn_chapters, 'Tom'),
        'Huck', np.char.count(huck_finn_chapters, 'Huck')
    ])

# Plot the cumulative counts:
# how many times in Chapter 1, how many times in Chapters 1 and 2, and so on.

cum_counts = counts.cumsum().with_column('Chapter', np.arange(1, 44, 1))
cum_counts.plot(column_for_xticks=3)
plots.title('Cumulative Number of Times Each Name Appears', y=1.08);
```

![5-literary-characters-3-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84846293-49563b80-b003-11ea-871f-ab0f2bd324c1.png)

In the plot above, the horizontal axis shows chapter numbers and the vertical axis shows how many times each character has been mentioned up to and including that chapter.

You can see that Jim is a central character by the large number of times his name appears. Notice how Tom is hardly mentioned for much of the book until he arrives and joins Huck and Jim, after Chapter 30. His curve and Jim's rise sharply at that point, as the action involving both of them intensifies. As for Huck, his name hardly appears at all, because he is the narrator.

Little Women is a story of four sisters growing up together during the civil war. In this book, chapter numbers are spelled out and chapter titles are written in all capital letters.

```Python
# The chapters of Little Women, in a table

Table().with_column('Chapters', little_women_chapters)
```

```
| Chapters                                                   |   |
|------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| 1. PLAYING PILGRIMS. "Christmas won't be Christmas ...     |   |
| 2. A MERRY CHRISTMAS. Jo was the first to wake in the ...  |   |
| 3. THE LAURENCE BOY. "Jo! Jo! Where are you?" cried ...    |   |
| 4. BURDENS. "Oh, dear, how hard it does seem to take ...   |   |
| 5. BEING NEIGHBORLY. "What in the world are you going ...  |   |
| 6. BETH FINDS THE PALACE BEAUTIFUL. The big house did ...  |   |
| 7. AMY'S VALLEY OF HUMILIATION. "That boy is a perfect ... |   |
| 8. JO MEETS APOLLYON. "Girls, where are you going?" ...    |   |
| 9. MEG GOES TO VANITY FAIR. "I do think it was the ...     |   |
| 10. THE P.C. AND P.O. As spring came on, a new set of ...  |   |

```

We can track the mentions of main characters to learn about the plot of this book as well. The protagonist Jo interacts with her sisters Meg, Beth, and Amy regularly, up until Chapter 27 when she moves to New York alone.

```Python
# Counts of names in the chapters of Little Women

counts = Table().with_columns([
        'Amy', np.char.count(little_women_chapters, 'Amy'),
        'Beth', np.char.count(little_women_chapters, 'Beth'),
        'Jo', np.char.count(little_women_chapters, 'Jo'),
        'Meg', np.char.count(little_women_chapters, 'Meg'),
        'Laurie', np.char.count(little_women_chapters, 'Laurie'),

    ])

# Plot the cumulative counts.

cum_counts = counts.cumsum().with_column('Chapter', np.arange(1, 48, 1))
cum_counts.plot(column_for_xticks=5)
plots.title('Cumulative Number of Times Each Name Appears', y=1.08);
```

Laurie is a young man who marries one of the girls in the end. See if you can use the plots to guess which one.

## Another kind of character
In some situations, the relationships between quantities allow us to make predictions. This text will explore how to make accurate predictions based on incomplete information and develop methods for combining multiple sources of uncertain information to make decisions.

As an example of visualizing information derived from multiple sources, let us first use the computer to get some information that would be tedious to acquire by hand. In the context of novels, the word "character" has a second meaning: a printed symbol such as a letter or number or punctuation symbol. Here, we ask the computer to count the number of characters and the number of periods in each chapter of both Huckleberry Finn and Little Women.

```Python
# In each chapter, count the number of all characters;
# call this the "length" of the chapter.
# Also count the number of periods.

chars_periods_huck_finn = Table().with_columns([
        'Huck Finn Chapter Length', [len(s) for s in huck_finn_chapters],
        'Number of Periods', np.char.count(huck_finn_chapters, '.')
    ])
chars_periods_little_women = Table().with_columns([
        'Little Women Chapter Length', [len(s) for s in little_women_chapters],
        'Number of Periods', np.char.count(little_women_chapters, '.')
    ])
```

Here are the data for Huckleberry Finn. Each row of the table corresponds to one chapter of the novel and displays the number of characters as well as the number of periods in the chapter. Not surprisingly, chapters with fewer characters also tend to have fewer periods, in general: the shorter the chapter, the fewer sentences there tend to be, and vice versa. The relation is not entirely predictable, however, as sentences are of varying lengths and can involve other punctuation such as question marks.

```Python
chars_periods_huck_finn
```

```
| Huck Finn Chapter Length | Number of Periods |
|--------------------------|-------------------|
| 7026                     | 66                |
| 11982                    | 117               |
| 8529                     | 72                |
| 6799                     | 84                |
| 8166                     | 91                |
| 14550                    | 125               |
| 13218                    | 127               |
| 22208                    | 249               |
| 8081                     | 71                |
| 7036                     | 70                |

... (33 rows omitted)
```

Here are the corresponding data for Little Women.

```Python
chars_periods_little_women
```

```
| Little Women Chapter Length | Number of Periods |
|-----------------------------|-------------------|
| 21759                       | 189               |
| 22148                       | 188               |
| 20558                       | 231               |
| 25526                       | 195               |
| 23395                       | 255               |
| 14622                       | 140               |
| 14431                       | 131               |
| 22476                       | 214               |
| 33767                       | 337               |
| 18508                       | 185               |

... (37 rows omitted)
```

You can see that the chapters of Little Women are in general longer than those of Huckleberry Finn. Let us see if these two simple variables--the length and number of periods in each chapter--can tell us anything more about the two books. One way to do this is to plot both sets of data on the same axes.

In the plot below, there is a dot for each chapter in each book. Blue dots correspond to Huckleberry Finn and gold dots to Little Women. The horizontal axis represents the number of periods and the vertical axis represents the number of characters.

```Python
plots.figure(figsize=(6, 6))
plots.scatter(chars_periods_huck_finn.column(1),
              chars_periods_huck_finn.column(0),
              color='darkblue')
plots.scatter(chars_periods_little_women.column(1),
              chars_periods_little_women.column(0),
              color='gold')
plots.xlabel('Number of periods in chapter')
plots.ylabel('Number of characters in chapter');
```
![6-another-kind-character-9-0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45191356/84846494-ce415500-b003-11ea-8081-0652ba52677d.png)

The plot shows us that many but not all of the chapters of Little Women are longer than those of Huckleberry Finn, as we had observed by just looking at the numbers. But it also shows us something more. Notice how the blue points are roughly clustered around a straight line, as are the yellow points. Moreover, it looks as though both colors of points might be clustered around the same straight line.

Now look at all the chapters that contain about 100 periods. The plot shows that those chapters contain about 10,000 characters to about 15,000 characters, roughly. That's about 100 to 150 characters per period.

Indeed, it appears from looking at the plot that on average both books tend to have somewhere between 100 and 150 characters between periods, as a rough estimate. Perhaps these two great 19th century novels were signaling something so familiar to us now: the 140-character limit of Twitter.
